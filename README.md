# Student-Information-system-Project
Our project is a Student Management System designed to streamline academic and administrative tasks. It manages student profiles, attendance, fee payments, and course registration with secure, role-based access for Admins and Students. Admins also get user management and reporting features, making the system efficient and user-friendly.

->Required Software
-VS CODE
-MySQL Server
-SQLTOOLS EXTENSION IN VS CODE
- My SQL CONNECTOR JAR FILE
- Download link: [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

-> Steps to Run the Project
- Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL Command Line.
- Create the database:

   CREATE DATABASE student_management;

-> Import the database structure (`SIS copydatabase.sql` file provided in the folder):
   
   $ mysql -u root -p student_management < SIS copydatabase.sql

-After creating a database, using the SQLTools extension in VSCode, connection should be  established.

-Just build it using ctrl+shift+build

-> Open the `DatabaseConnection.java` file.
   Update the database credentials:
  
   private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_management";
   private static final String USER = "root"; //should be Replaced with MySQL  username
   private static final String PASSWORD = "password";//should be Replaced with MySQL password
